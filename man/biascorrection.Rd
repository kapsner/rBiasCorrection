\arguments{
\item{experimental}{A character string. Path to the file containing the raw
methylation values of the samples under investigation.}

\item{calibration}{A character string. In type 1 data (one locus in many
samples, e.g. pyrosequencing data):
Path to the file containing the raw methylation values of the calibration
samples.
In type 2 data (many loci in one sample, e.g. next-generationsequencing
data or microarray data):
Path to the folder that contains at least 4 calibration files (one file
per calibration step). Please refer to the FAQ for more detailed
information on the specific file requirements (\url{
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kapsner/PCRBiasCorrection/master/FAQ.md
  }).}

\item{samplelocusname}{A character string. In type 1 data: locus name -
name of the gene locus under investigation. In type 2 data: sample name -
name of the sample under investigation.}

\item{minmax}{A logical, indicating which equations are used for
BiasCorrection (default: FALSE). If TRUE, equations are used that include
the respective minima and maxima of the provided data.}

\item{correct_method}{A character string. Method used to correct the PCR-
bias of the samples under investigation. One of "best" (default),
"hyperbolic" or "cubic". If the method is set to "best" (short: "b"),
the algorithm will automatically determine the best fitting type of
regression for each CpG site based on \emph{selection_method} (by
default: sum of squared errors, SSE,
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_sum_of_squares}). If the
method is set to "hyperbolic" (short: "h") or "cubic" (short: "c"), the
PCR-bias correction of all samples under investigation will be performed
with the hyperbolic or the cubic regression respectively.}

\item{selection_method}{A character string. The method used to select the
regression algorithm to correct the respective CpG site. This is by
default the sum of squared errors ("SSE"). The second option is
"RelError", which selects the regression method based on the theoretical
relative error after correction. This metric is calculated by correcting
the calibration data with both the hyperbolic regression and the cubic
regression and using them again as input data to calculate the 'goodness
of fit'-metrics.}

\item{type}{A single integer. Type of data to be corrected: either \code{1L} (one
locus in many samples, e.g. pyrosequencing data) or \code{2L} (many loci in one
sample, e.g. next-generation sequencing data or microarray data).}

\item{csvdir}{A character string. Directory to store the resulting tables.
(default = paste0(tempdir(), "/plotdir/")). CAUTION: This directory will
be newly created on every call of the function - any preexisting files will
be deleted without a warning.}

\item{plotdir}{A character string. Directory to store the resulting plots
(default = paste0(tempdir(), "/plotdir/")). CAUTION: This directory will
be newly created on every call of the function - any preexisting files will
be deleted without a warning.}

\item{logfilename}{A character string. Path to a file to save the log
messages (default = paste0(tempdir(), "/log.txt")).}

\item{plot_height}{A integer value. The height (unit: inch) of the
resulting plots (default: 5).}

\item{plot_width}{A integer value. The width (unit: inch) of the
resulting plots (default: 7.5).}

\item{plot_textsize}{A integer value. The textsize of the
resulting plots (default: 16).}

\item{seed}{A integer value. The seed used when solving the unknowns in the
hyperbolic regression equation and the cubic regression equation.
Important for reproducibility (default: 1234).}

\item{parallel}{A boolean. If TRUE (the default value), initializing
\code{future::plan("multicore")} (on unix systems) or
\code{future::plan("multisession")} (on non-unix systems) before running the
code.}
}
\value{
This function is a wrapper around all of \code{rBiasCorrection}'s
included functions. When executing it, it performs the whole workflow of
bias correction and writes resulting csv-files and plots, as well as a
log file to the local file system (the respective directories can be
specified with the function arguments). The return-value is TRUE, if the
correction of PCR measurement biases succeeds. If the correction fails,
an error message is returned.

This function implements the algorithms described by
Moskalev et. al in their article 'Correction of PCR-bias in quantitative
DNA methylation studies by means of cubic polynomial regression',
published 2011 in Nucleic acids research, Oxford University Press
(\doi{10.1093/nar/gkr213}).
